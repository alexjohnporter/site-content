###BEHAVIOUR DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAT: TELLING STORIES THROUGH CODE

Stories? Scenarios? BDD? Are these just more words in the ever-growing list of jargon that developers have to know? Or are they something more important than new terms to memorise?  
In this session we'll look at how BDD fits into the software development work-flow, how to tell user stories through features, and how to automate them in Behat.  
These techniques will help to ensure you're writing well designed and tested software that focuses on what the users want from a system.  

###CONTENT SECURITY POLICIES: LET'S BREAK STUFF

Content Security Policies are another tool we should have in our security toolbelt to help protect users of our sites.  
In this session I'll cover what they are, why they're needed, how they work and the limitations on what they can & cannot do to protect users.  
I'll demo attacks a CSP will block, break things, show what the different CSP directives & options will do and introduce some of the tools available to help with implementing a CSP on your sites!

Matt also proposed a lightning talk on running Multi-tenancy applications.
