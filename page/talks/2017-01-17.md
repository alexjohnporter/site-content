### Happy New Year! 

This is a socialize only session, no talks, just an opportunity to come and say hi to all your friends in the community. As usual we will have pizza and beer, a few announcements and couple small requests. 

One of those small requests I have right now, please go to [proposals section][2] and pick the topic which interests you the most for one of the future talks. 


**See you all on Tuesday, 17th of January.**
