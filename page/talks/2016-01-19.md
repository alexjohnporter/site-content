### Offline-first web development

Last time we were talking about building an API with Drupal 8,
this month we will explore offline-first approach to web development.
Glynn Bird is going to introduce a technique where your web-app writes its data
to an in-browser storage and syncs it back whenever internet connection is available. 


Glynn is a Developer Advocate at IBM Cloud Data Services and works with PHP and Node.js
