### Intro to real time development in PHP

This month we will look at real time apps and some of the libraries available.  
Join us, while we have a look at basics of [ReactPHP][3], [Ratchet][4] and in the end build a simple kanban task board using [AMPHP][1]

**Don't forget, inaugural [Scotland PHP Conference][2] is this month.**
