### From SQL to noSQL

Derick will explain the differences between various types of noSQL databases 
as well as the [CAP theorem][3]. He will then illustrate which paradigm shifts are 
necessary to successfully implement noSQL, using MongoDB as an example.

> "The approaches to schema design, fault tolerance, the network breaking
> and latency are all things that are inherent to scalability with noSQL
> solutions and with this talk you will learn how to use MongoDB
> effectively considering all the above mentioned situations." -- Derick Rethans

Covered subjects include: CAP theorem, schema design, dealing with error
situations and architecture of multi-node set-ups.
