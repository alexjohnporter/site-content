### Testing, build automation and auto deployment

During our November meetup [Paul Dragoonis][2] is going to talk about making 
developers' lives easier.  
Presentation will start with tips about testing our apps and then, drawing on his vast 
experience, Paul will share his knowledge about build automation with Jenkins, 
drawing particular attention to build integrity. He will conclude with 
auto-deployment options after successful builds.
