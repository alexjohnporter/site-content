### Hack: An Evolution of PHP

Although PHP has several features that allow engineers to be extremely productive in it, it also has several rough edges and pitfalls that cause problems (and often give the language a bad name). Josh - in his talk - will introduce Hack, Facebook's dialect of PHP. Hack keeps most of the PHP language -- all of the parts that make engineers so productive -- but sands down several of the more problematic sharp edges. It also introduces several new features, such as a simple yet extremely powerful syntax for asynchronous IO, to make the language even more effective for existing PHP programmers and newcomers alike.

Josh Watzman is an engineer at Facebook working on HackLang and HipHopVM.
