### Software Design in PHP7

This talk covers the lessons learned on my journey of developing large-scale PHP applications for the past 10 years. 
I will cover the core areas of software design (OOD) and programming (OOP) that are important to consider 
when building your own software applications, with a focus on building them in PHP7.

#### Raffle

This month we have for you a JetBrains voucher, GlasgowPHP tee and a book "Learning PHP7 High Performance"
