### Teaching PHP - challenges, solutions & the future

Web development is a complex craft, and most of us, community members, worked and are still working hard on learning it.
Being a lecturer at Edinburgh Napier University, PHP enthusiast and interested in sharing the knowledge, Thomas Dutrion relates his personal experiences as a lecturer and the challenges he faced.  
Using the help of the community, he attempts to gather feedback in order to define a better framework to teach PHP.  
Join us and have your say in helping to teach PHP to the next generations!

**NOTE: This month we are back at STV HQ**
