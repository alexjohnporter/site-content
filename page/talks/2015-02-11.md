### Talmudic Maxims to Maximize Your Growth as a Software Developer

**AKA: "All I Really Need to Know, I Learned in Rabbinical School"**...  
<br/>
>You've been programming for a while now. You're beginning to feel that you've 
got a handle on things but at the same time can't escape the feeling that 
you've somehow plateaued in your growth as a software developer. In this talk 
Yitzchok, a rabbinic scholar and software developer, shares the 
"wisdom of the sages" as practical, actionable advice – strategies and 
tactics – that you can use to reinvigorate your growth as a software developer.  

<br/>
A very [well received talk][3] by Yitzchok (Coderabbi) who is visiting from USA.
