### Go 100% Code Coverage Or Go Home

Nothing seems to trigger a sudden outbreak of devs on soapboxes like
mentioning 100% code coverage:
<div style="width=60%">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en"
dir="ltr">“Without 100% code coverage, you’re definitely shipping bugs”
<a href="https://twitter.com/stuherbert">@stuherbert</a> <a

2017</a></blockquote>

</div>
But why is this still seen as controversial in 2017?

In this talk, Stuart will explain what 100% code coverage is, and what
it isn't. We'll look at the tools available, and their current
limitations. We'll look in depth at what it tells us, and just as
importantly, what it cannot tell us. 

But then we'll get into the real debate, the one that triggers that
recurring outbreak of soapboxes  Stuart will make the case for why he
promotes 100% Code Coverage as the minimum, why his own tests often
target 10 times that, and what it costs everyone involved whenever
developers fall short of that target.

This talk is a blend of technology, business cases and ethics. Stuart's
talks are interactive, two-way discussions (just like the one he gave at
PHP Warwickshire back in February:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v7msMOmIVgM). Bring your own stories and
counter-examples, and share them as the discussion unfolds @glasgowphp
in July!
