### Community project review

This month we will learn a bit about an organisation which helps local communities improve the lives of young people,
get to know the platform they are building in PHP and the issues they are facing 
and help them by reviewing the codebase behind a platform.  

**Here is more info about the platform**

communityteams.com is developing a kind of 'digital scrapbook' for community groups and has two
sections.   
The first records events and the other is for supporting community projects.
The recording of events feature allows community members 14 yrs+ to register:
 - a comment about an event,
 - the number of hours that team spends active and
 - can upload a photo of the event

These three elements can also be customised for every individual who attended the event, are
compiled into personalised folios and can generate easily downloadable statistics.  
The project support feature helps administrators (someone who is running the activity like the
youth worker, teacher, responsible adult) get the best project support and can include:
 - identifying projects by surveying group members
 - appointing leaders
 - reflecting on projects via exit questionnaires
 
Upon project completion, participants are given an online folio, to use for college/job applications,
so that the world can see what they have achieved.
