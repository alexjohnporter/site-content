### Events in practice

Events are nothing new, as long as there have been computers there has been software responding to events 
and moving a process along, but do we use events to the best of our abilities?
 
From dispatchers in our favourite frameworks to queuing systems to audit logs to infrastructure, 
events can be used to manage just about every part of our application. Join me on a journey to explore common 
event patterns and ways we can leverage events to create a richer experience for our users and the applications 
by removing synchronous requests and cleaning up the code that remains.
