### Ethical Engineering

Our increasingly connected world, along with the promises of Big
Data and Cloud Computing, offers us multitudes of opportunities to
model the world and build powerful technology to improve not only
the companies we work for but the lives of many. Yet far too often
we, as engineers, focus on providing a solution to the problem at
hand and overlook the problems that the solution itself might
cause. In this talk, Christopher examines some of the issues our world throws up,
and asks what it takes to engineer ethically.
