### Getting started with Dependency Injection

The Dependency Injection pattern separates the creation of objects 
and their dependencies and is used in many popular frameworks including 
Zend Framework, Symfony, Laravel & Silex.  
This session will look at what Dependency Injection is, 
why you should use it and the benefits it provides. 
We will also look at how to use a Dependency Injection Container to 
improve decoupling and make your projects easier to test and maintain.
