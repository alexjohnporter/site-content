### Continuous Delivery in an AutoScaling environment

From bootstrapping through provisioning to deployment, automating delivery in an environment with an unknown number of instances is tricky. In this month's talk David will explain how [SaltStack][3] and [Docker][4] are part of the solution his team implemented at [TeamRock][2], where flexibility, performance and speed are key to the success.  

[David McKay][1] is a Technical Director at [TeamRock][2] - a pioneering startup bringing old media to the 21st century.
