### Behaviour Driven Development and Behat: Telling Stories Through Code

Stories? Scenarios? BDD? Are these just more words in the ever-growing list of jargon that 
developers have to know? Or are they something more important than new terms to memorise?  

In this session we'll look at how BDD fits into the software development work-flow, 
how to tell user stories through features, and how to automate them in Behat.  

These techniques will help to ensure you're writing well designed and tested software that 
focuses on what the users want from a system.
