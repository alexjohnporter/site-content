### Symfony4 & Flex - should you upgrade?

In this talk we will have a quick intro to Symfony Flex followed by a look
at the possible paths of upgrade for Symfony3 codebases. We will outline
benefits and disadvantages and draw some subjective conclusions.  
If you have already made an upgrade, join us and share your experience with
those who may still be considering the move.

Big thanks to this months sponsors **STV** and **Inviqa**.  
Both companies are currently hiring. Make sure to check them out!
