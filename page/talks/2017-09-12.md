### Social

Come and meet other PHP programmers. Chat, have a pizza and a pint.
We may review past month in PHP and if there is interest try a bit of Lean Coffee style conversation.

<br/>
Markup, our hosts for the evening, are [looking for skilled developers](https://www.usemarkup.com/careers).  
If you are looking for a new and exciting challenge consider coming to the meetup and having a chat with them.
