### Refactoring Large Legacy Applications with Laravel

You've been given the task of refactoring that legacy app, 
so what are you going to do to make sure you're leaving something better? 
How are you going to tackle something made over the years with features built and 
understood by those who've left and live in infamy?  
In this talk we'll 
look at different techniques you can take to overhaul legacy applications.  
We'll work from the ground up with planning, production, and aftercare: 
focusing on 3 different approaches with Laravel you can take depending on your time, 
budget, and needs so you'll end up with a legacy to be proud of.
