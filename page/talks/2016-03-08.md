### Kickass Dev Environments with Docker

Docker, the hottest technology around at the moment. It swept the Ops world by storm in 2014, became mainstream in 2015, and now itâ€™s set to dominate the developer world, in 2016.  
<br/>
Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary - akin to the phar, but in Hulk mode. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production.  
<br/>
In this talk I will cover the creation of this utopian distributable and show you how to compose your entire production infrastructure locally with only a small YAML file and without installing a single thing.  
<br/>
Lets say hello, to Docker.
