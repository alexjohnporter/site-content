#### Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers are bound by the following code of conduct. Lack of awareness is not an excuse. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event and we are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.  
<br/>

**Need Help?**

Enquiries and complaints of any type should be sent to either of these:

**Short Version**

Organizers of GlasgowPHP are dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of meetup participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup without a refund at the discretion of the meetup organisers.  
<br/>

**Slightly Longer Version**

Harassment includes - but is not limited to - offensive verbal comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to this code of conduct. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff immediately.

GlasgowPHP organizers will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the meetup. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at event venues and GlasgowPHP related social events.
