### So you want to speak...

### Speaker package

We want to reward the time you put into preparing the talk/session. That's why
we have a small giftbag for our speakers. You can expect a GlasgowPHP t-shirt
as well as a bottle of either foreign or locally sourced alcoholic beverage
(let us know if you prefere non-alcoholic option).
