with a slot. If you are unsure about the subject, below you can find a few 
general suggestions from the community.  
<br/>
BDD and DDD  
AWS environment  
Algorithms  
Current RFCs and PHP-FIG PSRs

### Speaker package

We want to reward the time you put into preparing the talk/session. That's why
we have a small giftbag for our speakers. You can expect a GlasgowPHP t-shirt
as well as a "mystery bottle" of either foreign or locally sourced alcoholic 
beverage.
